# Solutions for 5th sem ML lab

This repository contains solutions for the 5th semester Machine Learning lab. The solutions are implemented in Python and make use of various machine learning techniques and libraries.

## Used Frameworks

- Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the solutions.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning and data mining.

## Concepts used

- Machine Learning: The core concept used throughout the solutions. Various machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated.
- Neural Networks: Used the MLPClassifier from Scikit-learn for creating a multi-layer perceptron that can learn and make decisions on its own.
- Data Preprocessing: Used Pandas for data cleaning and preparation before feeding it into the machine learning models.
- Model Evaluation: Used various metrics to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
